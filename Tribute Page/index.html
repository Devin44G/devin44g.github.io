  <ul id="tribute-list">
    <li>
      <b> January 3, 1892: </b> J. R. R. (James Ronald Reuel) Tolkien was born
      in Bloemfontein in South Africa.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1904: </b> Mabel Tolkien, J. R. R. Tolkien's mother, died of acute
      diabetes at around the age of 34. Tolkien was 12.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1909: </b> Tolkien put together <em>The Book of the Foxroot</em>,
      a sixteen page notebook showcasing the "earliest example of one of his invented
      alphabets." It was in the summer of this very same year that Tolkien decided
      he was in love with a woman who was three years his senior. Her name was Edith
      Mary Bratt.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1911: </b> While at King Edward's school, Tolkien and three of his
      friends formed the Tea Club and Barrovian Society (T.C.B.S.)

      <b> 1914: </b> Britain entered into World War I.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1915: </b> Tolkien, having elected not to volunteer to join the British
      Army and, instead, finish his studies (much to the scrutiny of his own relatives),
      graduated Exeter College with first-class honours. After he graduated, however,
      he was comissioned as a temporary second lieutenant in Lancashire Fusiliers.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1916: </b> In March, Tolkien married Edith Bratt at St. Mary Immaculate
      Roman Catholic Church, in Warwick, England. In July of this same year, Tolkien
      arrived at the Somme and participated in the assaults on the Schwaben Redoubt
      and the Leipzig salient. And in November, he was invalidated back to England
      (where he rotated between hospitals and garrison duities) after having caught
      trench fever.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1920: </b> Tolkien left the army and became the youngest professor at
      the Univerity of Leeds in the very same year.

    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1937-1949: </b> J. R. R. Tolkien undertook the massive, creative work
      which would make his name nearly synonomous with the fantasy book genre as
      a whole and would inspire creatives for decades (perhaps, centuries) to come.
      <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1954-1955: </b> The trilogy was published over the course of one year.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1957: </b> <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> was awarded the International
      Fantasy Award.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1961: </b> Tolkien's dear friend, C. S. Lewis nominated him for the
      Nobel Prize in Literature.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> 1971: </b> Tolkien's beloved wife, Edith, died.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b> September 2, 1973: </b> J. R. R. Tolkien died and was buried with his
      wife. His legacy and his inspiration, however, has proved timeless.
